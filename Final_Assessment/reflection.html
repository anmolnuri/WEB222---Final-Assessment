        As more companies and organizations turn to the web to communicate with the world, Responsive Design has played
        a significant role in delivering this content. Responsive Web Design considers the wide range of devices
        consumers will use when navigating the web. Many of these devices, such as computers, phones, tablets, differ in
        the display screen size. When considering the rise of mobile devices around the world, every company must aim to
        deliver a positive mobile experience for their website. Website across different devices should perform
        seamlessly without performance being negatively affected. The best technique for this demand is to automatically
        reformat a website's layout when accessing the contents of a website across different devices.
        <br>

        The underlining goal of Responsive Design is to omit any scrolling, zooming, and resizing the websites. With
        Responsive Design, technologies can replace the need to create a mobile version of their website and adjust the
        content by using "media queries" to change the presentation of a website by scaling up or down to adapt to a
        device's environment. Using a Responsive Web Design template, clients will maximize the number of visitors
        surfing their website regardless of the platform they are using. Doing this provides an enhanced user experience
        while simultaneously boosting a company's search engine optimization. Search engines such as Google are inclined
        to give preference and higher ranking to mobile-friendly websites.
        <br>
        Through my research, I was also exposed to the numerous benefits of choosing Responsive Design. I will briefly
        summarize a few different benefits that justify its need in today's day and age and the ever-growing tech
        industry. Maintaining a website for a desktop browser and mobile device can become costly. Responsive Design
        allows companies to improve cost-effectiveness by having to pay for a single website. Implementing Responsive
        Web Design was necessary to have websites work across several platforms and future-proofing the website by being
        flexible and adaptable to new devices and technologies. Not to mention, businesses with few employees may not
        have the support or facilities to update or refresh the layout constantly. Opting to use Responsive Design can
        save time when managing a business' website and allows you to make swift and easy changes.

        I had a pleasant experience learning about the three pillars of web development. Building the foundational
        knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript from this course, I completed this assessment but feel tremendously
        confident about my capabilities to apply them to upcoming projects. I find it surprising and highly engaging to
        learn since updates HTML and CSS files can happen more rapidly, and the visual aspect of seeing changes is also
        satisfying to see. I found Javascript to be a fun and user-friendly language to learn. After taking this course,
        I agree that using a loosely typed language has advantages over strongly typed. This assessment also provides me
        with the knowledge of implementing all three pillars together. I was able to see dynamic changes being made by
        using the Document Object Model. Going forward, I will be putting an extensive amount of time and effort into
        enhancing my knowledge about web development and its usability in every way, which I predict will pay off in the
        long run.
